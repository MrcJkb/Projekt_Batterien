\subsubsection*{Interface} \label{sec:interface}
In OOP languages such as \java and C++, the term "interface" commonly refers to an abstract set of methods that specifies the behaviour that objects must implement. Unlike a class, an interface does not have any properties. \matlab\ OOP contains abstract classes, but no interfaces. However, in the terminology of OOP design patterns, an interface can also be an abstract class. In this documentation, an abstract class that defines the behaviour that objects must implement via a set of methods and/or properties is referred to as an "interface".
